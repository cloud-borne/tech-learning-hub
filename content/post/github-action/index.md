### Overview

Imagineü§î this: It's Fridayüçª, and you've just finished coding a complex piece of functionality. However, your teammates have already signed off for the weekend, leaving your code unreviewed until next week.  What if there was a programmer buddy who could take a look, every time you pushed code into GitHub, scans your code, highlights potential issues, suggests improvements, and even points out best practices. It's like having a second set of eyesüëÄ ‚Äì but those eyes never get tired or miss a detail.

What if you could elevate your code review process, making it ```faster```, ```smarter```, and more ```consistent``` without sacrificing ```quality```? Meet the game-changing duo: OpenAI-powered code reviews via GitHub Actions. 

We‚Äôll take an **MVP** approach (```Minimum Viable Product```) for our ```GitHub Action``` with only the required parts to understand the basics, then we‚Äôll add more functionality to it.

Let‚Äôs diveüê¨ in!

### Prerequisites

The things that you will need:

- üëâ [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- üëâ [Open-AI Account](https://platform.openai.com/)
- üëâ [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)

{{% stepper %}}
<div class="step">

  ## Step 1: Action Definition

  * The definition is stored in the ```action.yml``` file, put directly in the root of the repository.
  * The most minimal action definition is composed of a ```name``` and a ```runs``` object to define how the action is executed and what file to run. ```description``` and ```author``` are **optional**.
  * When **publishing** the action to the store, you might want to customize the appearance of the action in the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). This can be done by adding a ```branding``` object to the ```action.yml``` file.
  
    ```yml
    
    name: "Open-AI Code Review Action"
    description: "Perform code reviews and comment on diffs using OpenAI API."
    author: "Avijit Chatterjee"

    runs:
      using: "node20"
      main: "dist/index.js"
    branding:
      icon: "aperture"
      color: "green"
    ```

</div>
<div class="step">
  
  ## Step 2: Project setup
  
  * Let‚Äôs create an empty node project with ```npm init -y```.
  * You can now open ```package.json``` in your favorite IDE and add the build script:
    ```json
    {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "tsc"
      }
    }
    ```
  * Since we want to use **Typescript**, we‚Äôll need to install it as a dev dependency: ```npm install -D typescript```
  * Then we‚Äôll create a ```tsconfig.json``` by running ```npx tsc --init``` and we‚Äôll edit it to match our needs:
    ```json
    {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "ES2019",
      "module": "commonjs",
      "outDir": "dist",
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
      "strict": true,
      "skipLibCheck": true
      }
    }
    ```
</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 3: Project code

  * We can now create the ```src/index.ts``` file and start writing our action.
      ```js
      console.log('Hello World!');
      ```
    We‚Äôre building an **MVP**, right? So let‚Äôs keep it simple for now and focus on all the required steps. We‚Äôll have time to expand it later.

</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 4: Building the action

  * We can now ```build``` the action by running ```npm run build``` which will execute the ```tsc``` command as we defined in the ```package.json ```file. This will create a ```dist``` folder containing the compiled code.

    ```js
      dist
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
    ```
  {{% callout note %}}
  Noticeü´µ the ```outDir``` option in the ```tsconfig.json``` file, it was set to ```dist``` in **Step 2**.
  {{% /callout %}}

</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 5: Creating the repository

  * It‚Äôs time to create a ```git``` repository as we‚Äôll need to push our code to GitHub.

    ```sh
    git init
    ```

  * Add a ```.gitignore``` file to the project to avoid committing files that shouldn‚Äôt be tracked by git, for example, the ```node_modules``` folder. A quick way to do it is by running ```npx gitignore node``` which will create a ```.gitignore``` file with the most common entries for a node project. Commit and Push!

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin <remote-url>
    git push -u origin main
    ```

  {{% callout note %}}
  In our case we want to push the ```dist``` folder to GitHub, so we‚Äôll need to remove the ```dist``` entry from the```.gitignore``` file.
  {{% /callout %}}
  
</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 6: Creating a workflow

  * GitHub Actions are executed by ```workflows```. A workflow is defined in a ```.yml``` file stored in the ```.github/workflows``` folder of the repository so let‚Äôs create it.
    ```js
    mkdir -p .github/workflows
    touch .github/workflows/greet.yml
    ```
 
  * In our case, the action will checkout the current repository and then run the action we just created. We put ```./``` as the action path because we want to run the action from the current repository, but we could also use a different repository.
  * How does GitHub know what action to run? It‚Äôs defined in the ```action.yml``` file we created earlier.
  * One more line worth pointingü´µ is ```on: workflow_dispatch``` which tells GitHub to run the workflow when we manually trigger it from the Actions tab. 
 
    ```yml
    name: Say Hello
    
    on:
      workflow_dispatch:

    jobs:
      run-my-action:
        name: Checks if this action works
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - uses: ./
    ```
  
</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 7: Running the workflow

  * We can now push our code to GitHub and see the action in action! 
  
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add workflow"
    git push
    ```
  * Once the code is pushed, we can go to the ```Actions``` tab and trigger the workflow manually.
  ![ga-workflow-dispatch](/images/uploads/ga-workflow-dispatch.png)

  * The workflow will start running and we‚Äôll see the logs of the action in the console.
  ![ga-run](/images/uploads/ga-run.png)

  Congratulations!üôå You just created and ran your first GitHub Action!
  
  Now let's build on the **MVP** and add code for our use case.
  
</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 8: Create an OpenAI API Key

  * First, you'll need an OpenAI API ```Key```üóùÔ∏è to give as an input. So let's create one...
  * You can get one from [OpenAl's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), which usually comes with some freeüÜì credit! 

  After that, the cost is $0.002 per token. You can generate approximately 750,000 words for $2. Once you click '*Create a new secret key*' - you will only be shown it **once**, so copy and save it right away, or you'll have to create a new one.

  ![open-ai-api](/images/uploads/open-ai-api.png)
  
</div>

<div class="step">

  ## Step 9: Add the Inputs

  * For our **Code Review**üïµüèº use case , our GitHub Action requires specific inputs, which are defined within the ```inputs``` object of the ```action.yml``` file:

    * ```GITHUB_TOKEN```: In order to add comments to a Pull Request, we need to use the
    [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28). To authenticate your requests to GitHub, you will need to provide this **authentication** token
    * ```OPENAI_API_KEY```: To make authenticated requests to the OpenAI API
    * ```OPENAI_API_MODEL```: Making the choice of **LLM** configurable.
    * ```MAX_TOKENS```: Your rate **limit** to avoid the unexpected.
    * ```exclude```: Glob patterns to exclude files from the diff analysis
    * ```custom_prompts```: ```LLM``` Prompt for **Code Review** action

    ```yml
    name: "Open-AI Code Review Action"
    description: "Perform code reviews and comment on diffs using OpenAI API."
    inputs:
      GITHUB_TOKEN:
        description: "GitHub token to interact with the repository."
        required: true
      OPENAI_API_KEY:
        description: "OpenAI API key for GPT."
        required: true
      OPENAI_API_MODEL:
        description: "OpenAI API model."
        required: false
        default: "gpt-4"
      max_tokens:
        description: "Maximum number of tokens that can be generated per analysis."
        required: false
        default: "700"
      exclude:
        description: "Glob patterns to exclude files from the diff analysis"
        required: false
        default: ""
      custom_prompts:
        description: "Custom commands to augment the agent's prompts with. Each line is an individual command."
        required: false
        default: ""
    runs:
      using: "node20"
      main: "dist/index.js"
    branding:
      icon: "aperture"
      color: "green"
    ```

</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 10: Create the code-review workflow:

  * Replace the ```greet.yml``` workflow with the ```code-review.yml``` workflow.
  * Noteü´µ instead of triggering manually i.e.```on: workflow_dispatch``` we trigger the action ```on: pull_request``` being *opened/synchronize/ready_for_review* for review. 
  * We provide the input values for the action to run with as defined in the ```action.yml```
  * Since we intend to push this code upto GitHub we are using [Github Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) to pass on secrets. 

  ![ga-secrets](/images/uploads/ga-secrets.png)
 
  <details>
  <summary>code-review.yml</summary>

  ```yml
  name: Code Review with OpenAI

  on:
    pull_request:
      types:
        - opened
        - synchronize
        - ready_for_review
  permissions: write-all
  jobs:
    code_review:
      if: '! github.event.pull_request.draft'
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Code Review
          uses: ./
          with:
            GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
            OPENAI_API_MODEL: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
            exclude: "yarn.lock, dist/**, **/*.json, **/*.md, **/*.yaml, **/*.xml"
            custom_prompts: |
              Do not worry about the verbosity of variable names, as long as they are somewhat descriptive.
              Be sure to call out concurrency issues and potential race conditions.
              Do not worry about things a static analyzer would catch in real-time during development.
  ```

<div class="step">

  ## Step 11: Add the Dependencies 

  * Install the *dependencies* and *dev-dependencies* we would need:

    * **@actions/core**: Core functionalities for ```GitHub Actions```.
    * **openai**: OpenAI client for interacting with the ```OpenAI API```.
    * **@octokit/rest**: GitHub ```REST API``` client.
    * **parse-diff**: Library for parsing **diffs**.
    * **minimatch**: Library for **matching** file paths against glob patterns.
      ```js
      npm install <dependency>
      ```
    
    * **@vercel/ncc**: Build tool that is designed to compile a ```Node.js``` project into a **single** file, which includes all its **dependencies**.
    * **jest**: The core testing framework.
    * **ts-jest**: Transforms TypeScript to JavaScript, allowing Jest to work with TypeScript code.
    * **@types/jest**: Provides type definitions for Jest, enabling you to write type-safe tests in TypeScript.

      ```js
      npm install --save-dev <dependency>
      ```

</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 11: Fix Build Setup 

  * When creating ```GitHub Actions```, you often need to ensure that your action and all its **dependencies** are available in the GitHub Actions runner environment. By using ```@vercel/ncc```, you can **bundle**üì¶ everything into a single file, making it easier to distribute and use.

  * We need to update our build script in ```package.json``` to use it.
    ```js
    "build": "tsc && ncc build lib/index.js"
    ```
  * We also need to change ```outDir``` in ```tsconfig.json``` to lib.
    ```js
    "outDir": "lib"
    ```
  * You might also want to **double-check** that ```lib``` is in your ```.gitignore``` file but ```dist``` is not. This is our desired behavior as lib will only have our code in javascript, but dist will have the whole action.

  * We can now run ```npm run build``` again, then **commit** and **push** the changes.

  ## Step 12: Update the Action code

  ## Step 13: Test Setup

  * You wouldn‚Äôt push code into production without testingüß™ it, right? So let‚Äôs write some tests for our action.
  * We need to create a new config file for jest, in the root of our project, called ```jest.config.json```.
  * We‚Äôre telling jest to use the ```ts-jest``` preset, to run the tests in node, to collect coverage and to ignore some files.

    ```json
    {
    "preset": "ts-jest",
    "testEnvironment": "node",
    "collectCoverage": true,
    "coverageReporters": ["lcov", "text-summary"],
    "collectCoverageFrom": ["src/**/*.ts"],
    "coveragePathIgnorePatterns": ["/node_modules/", "/__tests__/"],
    "testPathIgnorePatterns": ["/node_modules/"]
    }
    ```
  * Without any extra configuration, the build will also include test files, which we don‚Äôt want. On ```tsconfig.json```, we can add a new exclude property:
    ```js
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.test.ts"]
    ```
</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 14: Writing the tests

  * We can now create a new file called index.test.ts in the ```src/__tests__``` folder. This is where we‚Äôll write our tests.

  {{% callout soon %}}
  Coming soon...
  {{% /callout %}}

</div>
<div class="step">

  ## Step 15: Running the tests

  * Now it‚Äôs finally time to get rid of that "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" script in package.json. Just replace it with:
    ```js
    "test": "jest"
    ```
  * This will run jest with the configuration we just created. If you want to run the tests in watch mode, you can use ```jest --watch```.
  * We can now run ```npm test``` to run the tests. You should see something like this.
  Our action works as intended and we have some tests to prove it!

  ## Step 16: Publishing the action

  * If you remember we mentioned the **branding** section in the ```action.yml``` file. Let‚Äôs see what it‚Äôs all about.
    ```yml
    branding:
      icon: 'activity'
      color: 'green'
    ```
  * This will add a nice icon and a color to your action in the GitHub **Marketplace**. You can find the list of available icons [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#branding).

  * How do we publish our action? Just look at your GitHub repo. If you‚Äôve properly set up an ```action.yml``` file, you should see a banner at the top of the page like this one:
