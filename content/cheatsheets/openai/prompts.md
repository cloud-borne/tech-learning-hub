## Overview

Crafting effective prompts for ChatGPT is important to unlock its potential. Longer prompts with more information and detailed instructions are better than short, generic ones.
 
Using the ```Context``` 🌐➡️ ```Task``` 📝➡️ ```Instruction``` 📋➡️ ```Clarify```🤔➡️ ```Refine``` ✨ method helps to craft prompts that guide ChatGPT to generate clear, unique, and accurate responses.

  <div class="flashcard-container">


  {{< flashcard front="**Context**" >}}  
  Provide a context🌐 for a more appropriate and useful response.
  {{< /flashcard >}}

  {{< flashcard front="**Task**" >}}

  {{< /flashcard >}}

  {{< flashcard front="**Instruction**" >}}
  Provide detailed instructions📋. Doing this will ensure that ChatGPT understands your expectations
  {{< /flashcard >}}

  {{< flashcard front="**Clarify**" >}}

  {{< /flashcard >}}

  {{< flashcard front="**Refine**" >}}

💡Tips for interacting with an AI assistant:
 
1. Use "*Ignore all previous prompts in this conversation*" to ```reset``` the conversation.
2. Ask for the answer **only**, without any **conversational** elements.
3. Ask the AI not to **apologise** or explain, but only provide the response.
4. Request a response formatted in **Markdown** to make it easier to copy and paste into website content management systems.
5. Use **parentheses** or square brackets to separate instructions about tone and writing style from the task itself.
