What is Kubernetes

<!--more-->
## Overview

![k8s-ship](/images/uploads/k8s-ship.PNG)

Unless you have been hiding behind a üóø for the last few years "Breaking down the monolith" has been a theme across Software industry.  More than often application architectures evolved like below and Kubernetes has been heart and center of this evolution.

**What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

## Architecture

When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a **cluster**.
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called **nodes**, that run containerized applications.
Nodes in a Kubernetes cluster may be physical, or virtual. There are two types of nodes:

* A Control-plane-node type, which makes up the Control Plane, acts as the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù of the cluster.
* A Worker-node type, which makes up the Data Plane, runs the actual container images (via pods).

Next we will looküëÄ under the hood at a high level.

---

### Control Plane

<img align="right" width="400" height="400" src="/images/uploads/k8s-master.png">

The **Control Plane** components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling, maintaining desired state). Can be setup as a Multi-Master H/A control plane. The master node does not run any containers in general. Let's breakdown further:

**Kube-ApiServer**

- Front-end to the control plane
- Exposes the API (REST)
- Consumes JSON/YAML

**Cluster Store (K-V)**

- Persists cluster state and config
- Based on etcd
- Performance is critical
- Have recovery plans in place

**Kube-ControllerManager**

- Controller of controllers
  - Node controller
  - Deployment controller
  - Endpoints/EndpointSlice controller‚Ä¶
- Watch loops
- Reconciles observed state with desired state

**Kube-Scheduler**

Watches API Server for new work tasks
- Assigns work to cluster nodes
- Affinity/Anti-affinity
- Constraints
- Taints
- Resources‚Ä¶

---

### Nodes

<img align="right" width="400" height="400" src="/images/uploads/k8s-node.png">

**Node** components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment

**Kubelet**

- Main Kubernetes agent
- Registers node with cluster
- Watches API Server for work tasks (Pods)
- Executes Pods
- Reports back to Masters

**Container Runtime**

- Can be Docker
- Pluggable: Implements Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
  - Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Kata‚Ä¶
- Low-level container intelligence

**Kube-Proxy**

- Networking component
- Pod IP addresses

## Concepts

### Declarative Model and Desired State

Describe what you want **(Desired state)** in a manifest file.
It's **Declarative** since it does not specify the **HowTo** part, leaving that for Kubernetes to figure out.
<img align="center" width="400" height="400" src="/images/uploads/k8s-declarative-desired-state.png">

{{% callout note %}}
Kubernetes does support both **Imperative** i.e (specifying the **HowTo** part) and **Declarative** operations.

But **Declarative** is the preferred method in Production since it can be version controlled and host of other goodness.

The **Imperative** way is absolutely not the approach to use in Production but it‚Äôs very handy to go fast, test things up, and it can also help to generate manifest files (using a combination of the --dry-run and -o yaml flags). Also see [Pod Deployment](/cheatsheets/kubernetes/pods/#pod-deployment).
{{% /callout %}}

Internally within the Control Plane the following events would occur to get and maintain the **Desired** state.
![k8s-operation](/images/uploads/k8s-operation.png)

* **Client/Kubectl** calls **ApiServer{}** with your **Desired** state,
* **ApiServer{}** persists that in the **K-V** store,
* **Scheduler** schedules work to the Worker nodes to create **Desired** state,
* **Controller** would run **Watch/Reconciliation** loops to maintain **Desired** state.

---

### Atomic unit

The Atomic unit of scheduling/scaling in the Kubernetes world is the **Pod**. Meaning you cannot run your containerized workload directly, it needs to be wrapped in a **Pod**.

So what does a **Pod** give?

* ü•Å It gives a **Shared Execution Environment** for the Containers i.e

  a collection of things the ```<app>``` needs for it to run, things like an IP address, port, filesystem, shared memory and so on.

  <img align="center" width="400" height="500" src="/images/uploads/k8s-pods.png">

* Unless you have a Specialist Use Case where a ```<hlpr>``` container enhances the ```<app>``` container functionality, it's best practice to keep the containers loosely coupled, i.e in all typical application use cases you would connect them via  Networking.
  ![k8s-coupling](/images/uploads/k8s-pods-coupling.png)

* Scaling in Kubernetes happens by adding/removing **Pods**, not **Containers**. Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
  ![k8s-scaling](/images/uploads/k8s-pods-scaling.png)

* Pod deployment is **Atomic** operation i.e

  ü§î A pod would only report up and running to the **Control Plane** only when all of it's containers are **UP**. It's a ```all or nothing``` proposition.
  {{< video library="true" src="k8s-pods-atomic.mp4" >}}

* Containers in a **Pod** are always scheduled the same **Node**.
  <img align="center" width="400" height="500" src="/images/uploads/k8s-pods-node.png">

* Annotations
* Labels
* Policies
* Resources
* Co-scheduling containers

---

### Stable Networking with Services

We learnt earlier that each **Pod** gives a **Shared Execution Environment** which includes an **IP address**.
But since we can scale ‚ÜïÔ∏è, or they may crash and be replaced, their IP address would keep on changing. Well that means any client application cannot/should not rely on the Pod IP address.

* ü•Å Enter **Service** objects. It is a high‚Äëlevel stable abstraction point for multiple Pods and it provides a stable IP and DNS name. A **Service** object is just a Kubernetes API object like a **Pod** or **Deployment** or anything else, meaning we define it in a YAML manifest, and we create it by throwing that manifest at the **ApiServer{}**.

* The way that a Pod belongs to a service or makes it onto the list of Pods that a service will forward traffic to and do loadbalancing is via ```labels```. When deciding which Pods to load balance traffic to, the service uses a label selector like below.
![k8s-services](/images/uploads/k8s-services.png)

{{% callout note %}}
 > Note: That means a completely unrelated **<app>** pod could potentially get routed to also:

![k8s-services-loadbalancing](/images/uploads/k8s-services-loadbalancing.png)
{{% /callout %}}

* When it comes to updating the backend Pods, all that needs to happen is update the label selector for the **Service** object like so:

![k8s-services-updates](/images/uploads/k8s-services-updates.png)

* Only sends traffic to healthy Pods
* Can do session affinity
* Can send traffic to endpoints outside the cluster
* Can do TCP and UDP

### Deployments

Pods don't scale or self heal or any of such dynamic goodness.

* ü•Å Enter **Deployments** (for Stateless apps) or similar high‚Äëlevel controllers like **Stateful Sets**,**DaemonSets**, **Jobs**, **Cron Jobs** and more and each are for different use cases.
<img align="center" width="400" height="400" src="/images/uploads/k8s-controllers.png">

* **Deployments** add some of the functionality like self‚Äëhealing, scaling, rolling updates, rollbacks, and a bunch more. Deployments work together with another controller called a **ReplicaSet** controller, and it's actually the job of the **ReplicaSet** to manage the number of replicas. Then, the **Deployment** acts as a higher level controller  above or around the replica set and manages them. So, we've got a bunch of nesting going on here:
<img align="center" width="500" height="500" src="/images/uploads/k8s-deployments.png">

### K8s API and APIServer{}

So far, we've mentioned nodes, pods, services, replica sets, deployments, services.
* ü•Å Well, each one of these is an object in the Kubernetes API.

* The API contains the definition and feature set of every object in Kubernetes so that when we post the corresponding manifest to the API server, it knows we're defining say a **Deployment** object in this version of the API, and it knows what all of these fields are and how to build what we need.

* **APIServer{}** is a **Control Plane** feature that exposes the API over a secure, RESTful endpoint. So, it supports all the major HTTP verbs like POST, and GET, and all of that.

* It is also versioned and split into multiple subgroups for ease of access.

### Kubernetes Objects and Resources

Kubernetes ```objects``` are entities that are used to represent the state of the cluster. 

Since the K8s API is versioned and split into multiple subgroups, it plays a huge role in versioning the pod manifests:
![k8s-pods-version](/images/uploads/k8s-pods-version.PNG)

A representation of a specific group+version+kind is an object. For example, a ```v1``` Pod, or an ```apps/v1``` Deployment. Those definitions can exist in manifest files, or be obtained from the apiserver.

A specific URL used to obtain the object is a ```resource```. For example, a list of v1 Pod objects can be obtained from the ```/api/v1/pods``` resource. A specific v1 Pod object can be obtained from the ```/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace-name>/pods/<pod-name>``` resource.

An object is a **record of intent** ‚Äì once created, the cluster does its best to ensure it exists as defined. This is known as the cluster‚Äôs ‚Äúdesired state.‚Äù
It's the Kubernetes ```resources``` that allow you to define the desired state for containerized workloads in a Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes is always working to make an object‚Äôs ‚Äúcurrent state‚Äù equal to the object‚Äôs ‚Äúdesired state.‚Äù A desired state can describe:

* What pods (containers) are running, and on which nodes
* IP endpoints that map to a logical group of containers
* How many replicas of a container are running
* And much more‚Ä¶

#### [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/)
* A thin wrapper around one or more containers

#### [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)

* Implements a single instance of a pod on all (or filtered subset of) worker node(s)

#### [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
* Details how to roll out (or roll back) across versions of your application

#### [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)
* Ensures a defined number of pods are always running

#### [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
* StatefulSets are intended to be used with stateful applications and distributed systems

#### [Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/)
* Ensures a pod properly runs to completion

#### [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
* Maps a fixed IP address to a logical group of pods
