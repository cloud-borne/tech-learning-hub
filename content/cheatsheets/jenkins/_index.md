### Jenkins CheatSheets

Jenkins is the #1 Continuous Integration and Delivery server. Kohsuke Kawaguchi, one of the founders of CloudBees, created it in 2006 as the "Hudson" project. In 2011, the project was renamed to Jenkins.
Jenkins is maintained and supported by an independent and active community (https://www.jenkins.io).
These CheatSheets are intended for a quick reference to Jenkins
