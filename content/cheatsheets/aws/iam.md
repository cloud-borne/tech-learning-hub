Manage access to AWS resources

<!--more-->

## üîéOverview

![AWS-IAM](/images/uploads/aws-iam-background.png)

When deploying applications to AWS, ensuring **robust** security is ``` Job No:1Ô∏è‚É£```, not just to protect user data, but to safeguard internal operations. AWS Identity and Access Management (```IAM```) provides the foundation for managing authentication and authorization across cloud resources.

Accessing AWS services requires two things:
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the requester
- **Authorization**: Granting permission to perform specific actions on resources

## üë•IAM Principals

This diagram gives an overview of how the main entities within IAM relate to each other:
![Users-Groups-Roles](/images/uploads/iam-intro-diagram.png)

In IAM, a **Principal** is any entity that can be authenticated and make requests to AWS services. These include:

{{< accordion "IAM Users" >}}
  * Example: Human users like say a ```sysadmin``` managing different departments with distinct permissions.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "IAM Roles" >}}
  * Example: An ```EC2``` instance assumes a role via the metadata service to access S3 securely.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Applications" >}}
  * Example: ```Containers``` using IAM roles for tasks (via ECS Task Roles or IRSA in EKS)
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Federated Users" >}}
  * Example: GitHub OIDC with AWS for CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
{{< /accordion >}}

- **IAM Groups** are permission containers, and **not Principals**. They:
  - Organize users
  - Allow shared policy management
  - **Cannot** authenticate or make API calls
  - **Cannot** be referenced in resource-based policies
  - **Cannot** associate with a Permission Boundary

###### üë§IAM Users

Individuals with long-term **credentials** (username/password or access keys). They represent human identities or service accounts created within your AWS account.

- üîë Use Credentials
  - **Username/password** for AWS ```Console``` access
  - **Access keys** for programmatic access (```CLI, SDK```)
- üß† Use Cases
  - Human users (e.g., developers, admins)
  - Service accounts for legacy systems

###### üß¢IAM Roles
IAM Roles are temporary identities assumed by trusted entities. IAM Roles operate under two distinct policies, each serving a different purpose:

  - ü§ù Trust Policy (*Who Can Assume the Role*)
    - A Trust Policy defines who is allowed to assume the role. It‚Äôs attached to the role and evaluated by AWS STS during role assumption.
    - Trust policies are written in JSON and use the ```Principal``` element to specify trusted entities.
   
      Example: **EC2** Trust Policy
      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
              "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    - Assumption Mechanism:
      - Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you have access to (AssumeRole API)
      - Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 12 hour

  - üìúIAM Policy ‚Äì (*What the role can do once assumed*)
    - Defines the permissions granted once the role is assumed
    - Can be **inline** or **managed** policies
    - Controls access to AWS resources

      Example: IAM Policy attached to Role
      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
  - üß†Use Cases
    - EC2 accessing S3 without credentials
    - Lambda functions interacting with DynamoDB
    - Cross-account access
    - CI/CD pipelines assuming deployment roles

###### üß±Applications

Applications often act as **Principals** by assuming IAM Roles to access AWS services securely.
- Assume roles via SDK or CLI  
- Use environment variables or metadata endpoints

üß†Use Cases
- Backend services calling AWS APIs  
- Microservices accessing SQS/SNS  
- Containers using IAM roles for tasks (via ECS Task Roles or IRSA in EKS)

###### üåêFederated Users

Federated users are **external identities** authenticated via identity providers (IdPs) and mapped to temporary AWS credentials.

- Federation via `sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML` or `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`  
- Trust policy must reference the IdP ARN. 
- Example: GitHub OIDC Trust Policy
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:my-org/my-repo:ref:refs/heads/main"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Federation Types:
- **SAML 2.0**: Active Directory, ADFS  
- **OIDC**: GitHub Actions, Google Workspace  
- **Cognito**: Mobile/Web app users

üß†Use Cases
- Employees accessing AWS Console via corporate SSO  
- CI/CD pipelines assuming roles for deployment  
- External partners accessing shared resources

## üìúIAM Policies

- IAM **Policies** define what actions a **Principal**üë• can perform and on which resources. They are attached to IAM Users, Roles, or Groups.

- By default, all access is denied. Explicit `Allow` grants access; `Deny` overrides it.

- **JSON** Elements:

  | Element      | Description                                                                 |
  |--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `Version`    | Policy language version (`2012-10-17` is current)                           |
  | `Statement`  | One or more permission blocks                                               |
  | `Effect`     | Either `"Allow"` or `"Deny"`                                                |
  | `Action`     | **Explicitly** lists API operations to ```Allow``` or ```Deny``` (e.g.`"s3:GetObject"`)   |
  | `NotAction`  | Applies to **All** API operations **Except** those listed.                          |
  | `Resource`   | ARN(s) of the resources the action applies to                               |
  | `Condition`  | Optional block to refine when the policy applies                            |

  üîìExample: **AmazonSQSFullAccess** (AWS Managed Policy)
  
  Grants full access to all SQS queues in the account.

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sqs:*",
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  üéØExample: **CustomSQSQueuePolicy** (Customer Managed Policy)

  Scoped limited permissions to a single queue.

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "sqs:SendMessage",
          "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
          "sqs:DeleteMessage",
          "sqs:GetQueueAttributes"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:customSqsQueue"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- The `Condition` block allows fine-grained control over when a policy applies. It supports multiple operators and keys.

  **Syntax**
  ```json
  "Condition": {
    "{ConditionOperator}": {
      "{ConditionKey}": "{ConditionValue}"
    }
  }
  ```
  
  Examples: 
  - String Conditions:
    ```json
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "aws:PrincipalTag/job-category": "iamuser-admin"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ```json
    "Condition": {
      "StringLike": {
        "s3:prefix": [ "", "home/", "home/${aws:username}/" ]
      }
    }
    ```
  - Numeric Conditions
    ```json
    "Condition": {
      "NumericLessThan": {
        "s3:max-keys": "1000"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Date Conditions
    ```json
    "Condition": {
      "DateLessThan": {
        "aws:TokenIssueTime": "2025-09-30T00:00:00Z"
      }
    }
    ```

  - Boolean Conditions
    ```json
    "Condition": {
      "Bool": {
        "aws:SecureTransport": "true"
      }
    }
    ```

    ```json
    "Condition": {
      "Bool": {
        "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"
      }
    }
    ```

  - IP Address Conditions
    ```json
    "Condition": {
      "IpAddress": {
        "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
      }
    }
    ```

  - ARN Conditions
    ```json
    "Condition": {
      "ArnEquals": {
        "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
      }
    }
    ```

  - Tag Conditions

    ```json
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateVolume",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestTag/Env": ["Dev", "Prod"]
        },
        "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
          "aws:TagKeys": ["Env"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```json
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateVolume",
      "Resource": "arn:aws: ec2 :*:*: volume/*",,
      "Condition": {
        "ForAllValues: StringEquals": {
        "aws: TagKeys": ["Env", "CostCenter"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **NotAction**: ```NotAction``` is an advanced policy element that **explicitly** matches everything except the specified list of actions. Using ```NotAction``` can result in a shorter policy by listing only a few actions that should not match, rather than including a long list of actions that will match.
  - ```NotAction``` with ```Allow```: Allow all actions except the ones listed.
 
    **PowerUserAccess**:

    - Provide full access to AWS services and resources, but does not allow management of Users and groups. 
    - Note how ```NotAction``` is used with ```Allow``` instead of ```Deny```. Had we used ```Deny```, the subsequent ```Allow``` would have had no effect.

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "NotAction": [
            "iam:*",
            "organizations:*",
            "account:*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "account:GetAccountInformation",
            "account:GetPrimaryEmail",
            "account:ListRegions",
            "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
            "iam:DeleteServiceLinkedRole",
            "iam:ListRoles",
            "organizations:DescribeEffectivePolicy",
            "organizations:DescribeOrganization"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  - ```NotAction``` with ```Deny```: Deny all actions except the ones listed.
  
    **DenyAllUsersNotUsingMFA**:

    - The following conditional example denies access to **non-IAM** actions if the user is not signed in using ```MFA```. 
    - If the user is signed in with MFA, then the "Condition" test fails and the final "Deny" statement has no effect. 

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
          "Sid": "DenyAllUsersNotUsingMFA",
          "Effect": "Deny",
          "NotAction": "iam:*",
          "Resource": "*",
          "Condition": {"BoolIfExists": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false"}}
      }]
    }
    ```

## üößPermission Boundaries

Permission boundaries are **IAM controls** that define the maximum permissions a **Principal** (user or role) can have‚Äîeven if their attached policies allow more.

- Boundaries are **managed policies** attached to IAM users or roles  
  ![IAM-Permission-Boundaries](/images/uploads/aws-iam-permissions-boundary.png)

- Can be used in combinations of AWS Organizations SCP
{{< figure src="images/uploads/aws-iam-effective-permissions.png" class="alignright">}}
- AWS evaluates:
  - The **permissions policy** attached to the principal  
  - The **permission boundary**  
  - Organizational **SCP** policies
- The **intersection** of the 3 determines the effective permissions

  üß† Use Cases
  - Delegate IAM access safely  
  - Enforce guardrails for automation  
  - Limit scope of temporary elevated access

## üîëSTS

AWS Security Token Service (```STS```) enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for users.

- ```STS``` Important APIs:

   {{< figure src="images/uploads/aws-iam-assume-role.png" class="alignright">}}
  - **AssumeRole**: access a role within your account or cross-account
    - Provide access for an IAM user in your **own** AWS account or to another AWS account in the same AWS Organization (```Zone of Trust```) to access resources.
    - Provide access to IAM users in AWS accounts owned by **third parties**
    - You can specify ```Tags``` that you pass when you **assume** an IAM Role or federate user in STS. In the corresponding IAM Role then you can use the ```aws:PrincipalTag``` Condition to verify.
      ![IAM-Session-Tags](/images/uploads/aws-iam-sts-session-tags.png)
    - Your users must actively **switch** to the role using the AWS Management Console or assume the role using the AWS CLI or  AWS API
    - You can add **multi-factor** authentication (MFA) protection to the role.
    - Ability to revoke active sessions and credentials for a role (by adding a policy using a time statement ‚Äì ```AWSRevokeOlderSessions```)
    - When you **assume** a role (user, application or service), you **give up** your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the Role

{{% callout note %}}

The Confusedüòï Deputy: 

It's a security vulnerability where an entity that doesn't have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action. To prevent this, you would define an ```External-ID```, an optional identifier that you can use in an IAM role **Trust policy** to designate who can assume the role. Read more: [Confused Deputy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html)

![IAM-Confused-Deputy](/images/uploads/aws-iam-confused-deputy.png)

{{% /callout %}}

  - **AssumeRoleWithSAML**: return credentials for users logged with SAML
    - Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (```SAML``` 2.0)
    - Access to AWS Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API using temporary credentials. No need to create IAM Users for each individual employee
    - Need to setup a **trust** between AWS IAM and SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (both ways)
    ![IAM-AssumeRoleWithSAML-API](/images/uploads/aws-iam-assumerolewithsaml-api.png)
    ![IAM-AssumeRoleWithSAML-Console](/images/uploads/aws-iam-assumerolewithsaml-console.png)

  - **AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity**: return creds for users logged with an IdP
    - There could be two patterns: 
      - **External** ```users``` getting federated access. Idp providers include *Amazon*, *Facebook*, *Google*, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider
      ![IAM-AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](/images/uploads/aws-iam-assumerolewithwebidentity-cognito.png)

      - **Machine-to-Machine** federated access to AWS resources. GitHub OIDC with AWS for CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
      ![IAM-AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](/images/uploads/aws-iam-assumerolewithwebidentity.png)

  - **GetSessionToken**: for MFA, from a user or AWS account root user
  - **GetFederationToken**: obtain temporary creds for a federated user, usually a proxy app that will give the creds to a distributed app inside a corporate network

## üîêResource Policies

A ```Resource Policy``` is an IAM policy that's attached directly to a **Resource** instead of to an **IAM identity** (user, role, or group). It specifies which ```Principals``` are allowed to access that resource and what actions they can perform.

- Resource-Based Policies are like saying: ‚ÄúI, the resource, allow you to do this.‚Äù
- Resource-based policies live on the resource itself and can grant cross-account access without needing to create roles in the target account.
- Example: Allow read access to all objects in example-bucket for the root user of account 
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root" },
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Example: Specifies the IAM role in Account-222222222222 that‚Äôs allowed to invoke the function in Account-111111111111
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "AllowCrossAccountInvoke",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/ExternalLambdaInvokerRole"
        },
        "Action": "lambda:InvokeFunction",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111111111111:function:my-function"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## üÜöIAM Roles vs Resource Policies

**Functional Difference**

- When you **assume** an ```IAM Role``` (user, application or service), the Principal gives up his original permissions and takes the permissions assigned by the ```Role```
- When using a ```Resource-Based``` policy, the Principal doesn‚Äôt have to give up any permissions
- üß†Use Case: User in Account-A needs to scan a ```DynamoDB``` table in Account-A and dump it in an ```S3``` bucket in Account-B.

![IAM-VS-Resource-Policy](/images/uploads/aws-iam-vs-resource-policy.png)


| Feature                          | Resource-Based Policy                               | IAM Role                                               |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attached To**                  | AWS resource (e.g., S3 bucket, Lambda)              | IAM entity (role)                                      |
| **Who Grants Access**            | The resource itself                                 | IAM role trust policy + identity-based permissions     |
| **Cross-Account Access**         | Directly supported via `Principal`                  | Requires trust relationship + assume-role permissions  |
| **Granularity**                  | Fine-grained per resource                           | Fine-grained per identity                              |
| **Use Case**                     | Let external accounts/services access your resource | Let internal/external identities assume permissions    |
| **Management Location**          | Resource console (e.g., S3, Lambda)                 | IAM console                                            |
| **Scalability**                  | Less scalable (policy size limits)                  | More scalable and reusable across services             |
| **Policy Evaluation Context**    | Evaluated from the resource's perspective           | Evaluated from the identity's perspective              |
| **Principal Definition**         | Explicitly defined in the policy                    | Defined via trust policy and `sts:AssumeRole`          |

## üõ£Ô∏èService Control Policies (SCP)

- Define **Allow** or **Deny** IAM actions
- Applied at the ```OU``` or ```Account``` level
- Does **not** apply to the ```Management Account```
- SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles in the account, including **Root** user
- The SCP does not affect ```Service-linked``` roles. Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations
and can't be restricted by SCPs.
- SCP must have an explicit **Allow** from the root a each OU in the direct path
to the target account (does not allow anything by default)
- üß† Use cases:
  - Restrict access to certain services (for example: can‚Äôt use ```EMR```)
  - Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services

![IAM-SCP](/images/uploads/aws-iam-scp-hierarchy.png)

Example: ```SCP``` denies all actions in any AWS region that is not **eu-west-1** or **eu-west-2**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyAllRegionsExceptSpecified",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "NotAction": [
        "iam:*",
        "aws-portal:*",
        "organizations:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": [
            "eu-west-1",
            "eu-west-2"
          ]
        },
        "ArnNotEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SecurityAuditorRole"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
- The ```StringNotEquals``` condition checks the ```aws:RequestedRegion``` variable, which specifies the region for the API call.
- This policy includes a ```NotAction``` element for services like IAM, AWS Portal, and Organizations. This is a best practice because these are ```Global``` services and a regional Deny would prevent core functions. Because all requests to these services are made to the us-east-1 Region, these requests would get denied without the NotAction element. 
- We also configure an **Auditor** Role with the ARN ```arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SecurityAuditorRole```. This role needs to run security scans and compliance checks across all regions, so it must be exempt from the regional restriction.

## üé≠Session Policy

An IAM ```Session Policy``` is a way to temporarily limit the permissions of an IAM role or a federated user. Think of it as a temporary filter that's applied only for the duration of a specific session.

- How it works: The final permissions for the session are the intersection of the original IAM policy (the one attached to the role) and the session policy. An explicit ```Deny``` in either policy will always take precedence over an ```Allow```.

- How you use it: You can't attach a ```Session Policy``` directly. Instead, you pass it as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary session using AWS CLI or an API (like ```sts:AssumeRole```).

- Why Use Them?
Session policies are a powerful security tool because they help you enforce the principle of least privilege. Instead of creating a dozen different roles for specific, temporary tasks, you can use one general role and then dynamically "scope it down" with a session policy for each unique task.

üß†Use Case: Imagine you have the All-Powerful ```AdministratorRole``` that grants a user full control over your AWS account. You need to give a developer temporary access to only list S3 buckets‚Äîand nothing else.

- Define a session policy: You create a JSON file that explicitly allows only the ```s3:ListAllMyBuckets``` action.

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Apply the policy: You use the aws sts assume-role command and pass that JSON file using the --policy parameter.

  ```bash
  aws sts assume-role \
      --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AdminRole \
      --role-session-name S3-Read-Only-Session \
      --policy file://s3-list-policy.json
  ```

## üìÖIAM Identity Center

A centralized service to manage single sign-on (```SSO```) access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications across your AWS Organization. It simplifies access management at scale.

- It's a global service, not tied to a single region.
- It uses ```Permission Sets``` to define and deploy roles across member accounts.
- You can either use the built-in IAM ```Identity Center``` Directory or connect to an external identity provider (IdP) like ```Active Directory```, ```Okta```, or ```Azure AD```.
- Identity Center automatically provides **short-lived**, rotating credentials for console, CLI, and SDK access, which is a major security benefit.
