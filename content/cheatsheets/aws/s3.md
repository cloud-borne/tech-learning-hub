Scalable Storage in the Cloud

<!--more-->

## üîéOverview

* **K**ey-**V**alue based object storage with *unlimited* storage, *unlimited* objects up to **5 TB** for the internet
* ```S3``` is an **Object level storage** (not a Block level storage) and cannot be used to host OS or dynamic websites (but can work with Javascript SDK)
* provides **durability** by redundantly storing objects on multiple facilities within a region
* regularly verifies the integrity of data using **checksums** and provides auto healing capability
* integrates with ```CloudTrail```, ```CloudWatch``` and ```SNS``` for event notifications
* bucket names have to be **globally unique**
* data model is a **flat structure** with no hierarchies or folders
* **Logical hierarchy** can be inferred using the keyname prefix e.g. Folder1/Object1
* Objects stored in S3 have the URL format: 
  ```
  https://s3-[region].amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]
  ```
* If you host a static website in S3 the URL format: 
  ```
  http://[bucketname].s3-website-[region].amazonaws.com
  ```
* ```S3``` is object based. Objects consist of the following:
  * **Key** - unique, developer-assigned key
  * **Value** - this is the data which consists of sequence of bytes.
  * **VersionID** - used for versioning
  * **Metadata** - data about data e.g. Content-Type, Author, CreateDate etc.
  * **Subresources** - bucket specific configuration like Bucket policies and ACLs

## ü™£Buckets

* allows retrieval of 1000 objects and provides **pagination** support and is **NOT** suited for list or prefix queries with large number of objects
* with a single ```PUT``` operations, **5GB** size object can be uploaded
* use **Multipart upload** to upload large objects up to **5 TB** and is recommended for object size of over **100 MB** for fault tolerant uploads
* support **Range HTTP Header** to retrieve partial objects for fault tolerant downloads where the network connectivity is poor
* **Pre-Signed URLs** can also be used/shared for uploading/downloading objects for **limited time** without requiring AWS security credentials
* allows deletion of a single object or multiple objects (max 1000) in a single call
* **Multipart Uploads** allows:
  * **parallel uploads** with improved throughput and bandwidth utilization
  * fault tolerance and quick recovery from network issues
  * ability to **pause and resume** uploads
  * begin an upload before the final object size is known

#### Consistency

* provide **read-after-write** consistency for ```PUTS``` of new objects and **eventual consistency** for overwrite ```PUTS``` and ```DELETES```(i.e., updating or deleting existing objects)
* for new objects, **synchronously** stores data across multiple facilities before returning success
* updates to a single key are **atomic**

#### Versioning

* You can version your files in Amazon ```S3```. It is enabled at the **bucket** level.
* allows preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object
* Same key overwrite will increment the *version*.
* It is best practice to *version* your buckets to protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version) and easy roll back to previous version.
* Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version **null**
* Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
* protects individual files but does **NOT** protect from bucket deletion

#### S3 Static Website Hosting

{{< figure src="images/uploads/aws-s3-static-website.png" class="alignright">}}
- Bucket name must match the ```domain``` (e.g., example.com)
- Website files (HTML, CSS, JS) are uploaded to the bucket
- Key Configurations
  - Enable static website hosting in bucket properties
  - Set index document (e.g., ```index.html```)
  - Optionally set error document (e.g., ```404.html```)
  - Make objects **public** via bucket policy or ACLs

{{% callout note %}}

You could keep the S3 bucket **private** while hosting a static site if S3 is interfaced via ```CloudFront``` CDN. You would enable Origin Access Control (```OAC```) which would grant ```CloudFront``` permission to access private S3 objects.

{{% /callout %}}

#### CORS

* ```CORS``` - **C**ross **O**rigin **R**esource **S**haring is a typical concern when using resources from another ```domain```.
![AWS-STATIC-CORS](/images/uploads/aws-s3-static-website-cors.png)

* When using ```S3``` buckets to store static resources(images, js, css) for a WebApp, since S3 buckets are not in the same domain as the WebApp, the browser will block loading the resources.
* The requests won‚Äôt be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests, using ```CORS``` Headers 
( ```Access-Control-Allow-Origin```)
* To configure your bucket to allow **cross-origin** requests, you create a ```CORS``` configuration, which is an XML document with rules that identify the origins that you will allow to access your bucket, the operations (HTTP methods) that will support for each origin, and other operation-specific information.
* You can allow for a specific ```origin``` or for ```*``` (all origins):

  ```xml
  <CORSConfiguration>
    <CORSRule>
      <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
      <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
      <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
      <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
  </CORSConfiguration>
  ```

#### Replication

* Objects can be replicated between two buckets.
* Must enable **versioning** in source and destination Buckets
* Buckets can be in different accounts
* Copying is **asynchronous**
* Must give proper ```IAM``` permissions to ```S3```
* Replication could be
  - Cross Region Replication (CRR) - Use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
  - Same Region Replication (SRR) - Use cases: log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts
* After activating, only new objects are replicated (not **retroactive**)
* For ```DELETE``` operations:
  * If you delete without a version ID, it adds a ```delete``` marker, not replicated
  * If you delete with a version ID, it deletes in the source, not replicated
  * So in short ```DELETE``` operations are **NOT** replicated.
* There is no **chaining** of replication i.e. if bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3
  then objects created in bucket 1 are not replicated to bucket 3

## üõ°Ô∏èSecurity

* **IAM policies** ‚Äì grant users within their **own** AWS account permission to access S3 resources.
  * Example: S3 IAM Access
  -  Allows the user to perform ```s3:ListBucket``` on the root of the specified bucket(**<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_HERE>**) in a specified AWS region(**<YOUR_REGION>**) originating from a specific IP (**<YOUR_IP>**/32)
  - Grants ```s3:GetObject``` and ```s3:PutObject``` permissions within a user-specific folder. Same IP and region restrictions apply.
  - Allows ```s3:PutObject``` only if the object is encrypted using ```SSE-S3``` (AES256).

            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
    }
    ```

* **Bucket and Object ACL** ‚Äì grant **other** AWS accounts (not specific users) access to S3 resources
* **Bucket policies** ‚Äì allows to add or deny permissions across some or all of the objects within a single bucket
  * Example - **Anonymous** Read Access

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Id": "Policy1589785443274",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "Stmt1589785361449",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": "*",
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucketname>/*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  * Example - **Origin Access Control** via ```CloudFront```

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::<ACCOUNT_ID>:distribution/<CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
  }
  ```
  * Example - **MultiFactorAuth**
  
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "EnforceMFAForObjectDelete",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:DeleteObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*",
            "Condition": {
                "Null": {
                    "aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
  }
  ```

## üìÇStorage

  * designed to **sustain the loss of data in a two** facilities
  * **99.999999999% durability** & **99.9% availability**
  * suitable for **objects greater than 128 KB** kept for at **least 30 days**

* **One Zone-IA**
  * High durability (99.999999999%) in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed
  * 99.5% Availability
  * Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data, or data you can recreate

* **Glacier Instant Retrieval**
  * Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
  * Minimum storage duration of 90 days

* **Glacier Flexible Retrieval**
  * suitable for **archiving data** where data access is **infrequent** and retrieval time of several (3-5) hours is acceptable.

* Comparison of Storage Tiers

  ![](/images/uploads/s3-storage-tiers1.png)

  ![](/images/uploads/s3-storage-tiers2.PNG)

#### Storage Lifecycle

* You can transition objects between storage classes either manually or via **Lifecycle** policies.
* Here's a diagram to show the transition paths possible:

  ![](/images/uploads/s3-lifecycle-policies.PNG)

* Transition actions: It defines when objects are transitioned to another storage class. Like for eg:
  * Move objects to ```Standard IA``` class 60 days after creation
  * Move to ```Glacier``` for archiving after 6 months
  * Expiration actions: configure objects to expire (delete) after some time
  * Access log files can be set to delete after a 365 days
  * Can be used to delete old versions of files (if versioning is enabled)
  * Can be used to delete incomplete multi-part uploads
* Rules can be created for a certain prefix (ex - s3://mybucket/mp3/*)
* Rules can be created for certain objects tags (ex - Department: Finance)

## üîêEncryption

* Supports HTTPS (```SSL/TLS```) encryption in **TRANSIT**üöå
* S3 Bucket Policies ‚Äì Force SSL:

  To force **SSL**, create an S3 bucket policy with a **DENY** on the condition ```aws:SecureTransport = false```

  ```JSON
  {
    "Id": "ExamplePolicy",
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "AllowSSLRequestsOnly",
        "Action": "s3:*",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET",
          "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*"
        ],
        "Condition": {
          "Bool": {
            "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
          }
        },
        "Principal": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

> Note: Using an **ALLOW** on ```aws:SecureTransport = true``` would allow anonymous ```GetObject``` if using SSL
> * Read more here: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-bucket-policy-for-config-rule/


* **Data encryption** at **REST**üí§. 

There are a several options:
  1. ```SSE-S3``` - **AES256** bit encryption, S3 managed keys
  2. ```SSE-KMS``` - KMS managed keys, customer has access to envelope key and that is a key which actually encrypts your data's encryption key, audit trail available via ```CloudTrail```
  3. ```SSE-KMS DSSE``` - Enables dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS DSSE).
  4. ```SSE-C```: customer managed encryption keys - keys are not stored in ```KMS```. **CloudHSM** could be used
  5. ```Client Side``` Encryption - key not stored in ```KMS```
  6. ```Glacier```: all data is **AES-256** encrypted, key under AWS control

* You configure a bucket to use *default encryption* via the S3 ```console```, ```CLI```, or ```API```. Ensures encryption even if clients forgets to include encryption headers.
* AWS automatically encrypts every object uploaded to the bucket unless the ```PUT``` request explicitly specifies a different encryption method.
* 	You can choose between:
  - ```SSE-S3``` (AES256)
  - ```SSE-KMS``` (aws:kms)
  - ```SSE-KMS DSSE``` (aws:kms:dsse)

* If the client wants the file be encrypted(or override *default encryption*) at upload time they can specify the ```x-amz-server-side-encryption``` header parameter in the request header.
* These are the possible values for the ```x-amz-server-side-encryption``` header:
  * ```AES256``` --> which tells S3 to use **S3-managed** keys,
  * ```aws:kms``` OR ```aws:kms:dsse```--> which tells S3 to use **KMS‚Äìmanaged** keys.
* The old way to enable default encryption in a bucket was to use a bucket policy and refuse any HTTP command without the proper headers:
* Security Policy for enforcing encryption via ```SSE-S3```:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "PutObjPolicy",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "DenyIncorrectEncryptionHeader",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "s3:PutObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*",
        "Condition": {
          "StringNotEquals": {
             "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
          }
        }
      },      
      {
        "Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "s3:PutObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*",
        "Condition": {
           "Null": {
              "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": true
          }
    }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* Security Policy for enforcing encryption via ```SSE-KMS```:

  It gets more interesting with the ```SSE-KMS``` case. Here we need to deny all requests that use the wrong encryption type, i.e. ```x-amz-server-side-encryption = AWS256``` or an incorrect KMS key, i.e. the value of ```x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id```. A rule for that looks like this (You need to replace $BucketName, $Region, $Accountid and $KeyId):  

  ```JSON
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Deny",
              "Principal": "*",
              "Action": "s3:PutObject",
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::$BucketName/*",
              "Condition": {
                  "StringNotEqualsIfExists": {
                      "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"
                  },
                  "Null": {
                      "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "false"
                  }
              }
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Deny",
              "Principal": "*",
              "Action": "s3:PutObject",
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::$BucketName/*",
              "Condition": {
                  "StringNotEqualsIfExists": {
                      "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id": "arn:aws:kms:$Region:$AccountId:key/$KeyId"
                  }
              }
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

{{% callout note %}}

- Bucket Policies are evaluated **before** *default encryption*.
- This means if your bucket policy **denies** uploads without encryption headers, the request will be blocked even before default encryption can apply.
- So if your policy requires encryption headers, you must ensure clients **explicitly** include them, or relax the policy to allow *default encryption* to do its job.
- If you're using *default encryption*, your bucket policy should not require encryption headers. Instead, use a defensive policy to enforce **HTTPS** but does not block *default encryption*.
```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name", "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"],
  "Condition": {
    "Bool": {
      "aws:SecureTransport": "false"

## üë£Access Logs

S3 Server Access Logging provides detailed records of the requests made to your S3 bucket. It's an essential feature for security auditing, access monitoring, and understanding your S3 traffic patterns.

{{< figure src="images/uploads/s3-access-logs.PNG" class="alignright">}}
* Any request made to S3, from any account, authorized or denied, will be logged into **another** destination S3 bucket
* The **destination** bucket must be in the same ```AWS Region``` and ```AWS account``` as the **source bucket**.
* That data can be analyzed using data analysis tools, or Amazon ```Athena```.
* The log format is explained here: [Log Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/LogFormat.html)
* **Do NOT** set your logging bucket to be the monitored bucket. It will create a *infinite* logging loop, and your bucket will grow in size exponentially.
* For the S3 logging service to write logs to your **destination** bucket, you must grant it ```s3:PutObject``` permission. You can do this using either a ```Bucket Policy``` (**recommended**) or an ```Access Control List``` (ACL)
  * ```Bucket Policy``` (Recommended): This policy allows the S3 logging service principal (```logging.s3.amazonaws.com```) to write objects into your specified log bucket and prefix.

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "S3ServerAccessLogsPolicy",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Service": "logging.s3.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-log-bucket-name/your-log-prefix/*",
                "Condition": {
                    "ArnLike": {
                        "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ss3:::your-source-bucket-name"
                    },
                    "StringEquals": {
                        "aws:SourceAccount": "your-aws-account-id"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

  * ```Bucket ACL``` (Legacy): You grant ```WRITE``` and ```READ_ACP``` permissions on the target bucket to the AWS ```Log Delivery``` group. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

    ```sh
    aws s3api put-bucket-acl \
        --bucket your-log-bucket-name \
        --grant-write 'uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery' \
        --grant-read-acp 'uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery'

üß† of it like this: an employee might have a modern ID badge with a chip (```logging.s3.amazonaws.com```) and an older, laminated ID card (```Log Delivery group```). Both cards belong to the same employee (the ```S3 Logging Service```) and both grant access to the same building (your **destination bucket**). They just work with different security systems (```IAM``` vs. ```ACLs```).

{{% /callout %}}

* Once permissions are set on the target bucket, you enable logging on the source bucket. Create a ```logging.json``` file and then apply the configuration to your **source bucket**.

  ```json
  {
      "LoggingEnabled": {
          "TargetBucket": "your-log-bucket-name",
          "TargetPrefix": "your-log-prefix/"
      }
  }
  ```
  
  ```sh
  aws s3api put-bucket-logging \
      --bucket your-source-bucket-name \
      --bucket-logging-status file://logging.json
  ```

## üìâPerformance

* Amazon ```S3``` automatically scales to high request rates, latency 100-200 ms
* Your application can achieve at least 3,500 ```PUT```/```COPY```/```POST```/```DELETE``` and 5,500 ```GET```/```HEAD``` requests per second per **prefix** in a bucket.
* There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket.

  Example (object path => prefix):

  - bucket/folder1/sub1/file => /folder1/sub1/
  - bucket/folder1/sub2/file => /folder1/sub2/
  - bucket/1/file => /1/
  - bucket/2/file => /2/

  If you spread reads across all four prefixes evenly, you can achieve (5500 * 4) = 22,000 requests per second for ```GET``` and ```HEAD```

* S3 ‚Äì ```KMS``` Limitation - If you use ```SSE-KMS```, you may be impacted by the KMS limits.
  When you upload, it calls the ```GenerateDataKey``` KMS API. When you download, it calls the ```Decrypt``` KMS API. These count towards the KMS quota per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region).
  As of today, you cannot request a quota increase for KMS.

* **Multi-Part** upload: Recommended for files > 100MB, must use for files > 5GB. Can help parallelize uploads (speed
  up transfers)

* S3 Transfer Acceleration (```S3TA```) - Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS ```Edge Location```.  From there it will forward the data to the ```S3``` bucket in the target region. Compatible with **Multi-Part** upload.

* S3 **Byte-Range** Fetches - Using the ```Range``` HTTP header in a ```GET``` Object request, you can fetch a **byte-range** from an object, transferring only the specified portion. Parallelize ```GETs``` by requesting specific byte ranges. Better resilience in case of failures. Can be used to speed up downloads. Can be used to retrieve only partial data (for example the ```HEAD``` of a file)

* ```S3 Select``` & ```Glacier Select``` - Retrieve less data using SQL by performing server side filtering. Can filter by rows & columns (simple SQL statements). Less network transfer, less CPU cost client-side

## ‚è≤Transfer Acceleration

AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration (```S3TA```) is a bucket-level feature that speeds up data transfers to and from your S3 bucket by using AWS's globally distributed CloudFront ```Edge Locations```. This bypasses the public internet for the majority of the journey, reducing latency and increasing throughput.

* ```S3TA``` routes data through the AWS global network, which is optimized for performance. When you upload data, it goes to the nearest Edge Location and then travels over the dedicated AWS backbone network to your ```S3``` bucket.

* The ```S3``` bucket name must be **DNS-compliant** and cannot contain periods (e.g., **my-bucket-name** is ‚úÖ, but **my.bucket.name** is ‚ùå).

* Could be enabled via Console, CLI or SDKs:

  ```sh
  aws s3api put-bucket-accelerate-configuration \
    --bucket YOUR-BUCKET-NAME \
    --accelerate-configuration Status=Enabled
  ```

* Once enabled on the bucket you must change the endpoint you use for transfers:

  * Normal S3 Endpoint: ```https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com```
  * S3 Transfer Acceleration Endpoint: ```https://<bucket-name>.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com```
  ```sh
  aws s3 cp --endpoint-url https://<bucket-name>.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com \ 
            <file-path> s3://<bucket-name>/
  ```
  * Alternatively, you can configure the AWS CLI to use the accelerated endpoint by default:
  ```sh
  aws configure set default.s3.use_accelerate_endpoint true
  ```

## ·ù∞.·êüPresigned URLs

* We can give users access to files in a bucket without giving them access to the bucket itself using ```Presigned URLs```. We can generate pre-signed URLs using SDK or CLI
  * For downloads (easy, can use the CLI)
  * For uploads (harder, must use the SDK)

* Valid for a default of 3600 seconds, can change timeout with ```--expires-in``` argument
* Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the person who generated the URL for ```GET```/```PUT```
* Examples :
  * Allow only **logged-in** users to download a premium video on your ```S3``` bucket
  * Allow an ever changing list of users to download files by generating URLs dynamically
  * Allow temporarily a user to upload a file to a precise location in our bucket

![S3-Presigned-URL](/images/uploads/aws-s3-presigned-url.png)

## üîäEvents

* When some **events** happen in the ```S3``` bucket (for e.g. S3:**ObjectCreated**, S3:**ObjectRemoved**, S3:**ObjectRestore**, S3:**Replication**‚Ä¶) you can create event notification **rules** and these rules would emit events which could trigger other AWS services like ```SQS```, ```SNS```, ```Lambda``` functions and ```EventBridge``` like so:
![S3-Event-Notification](/images/uploads/s3-event-notification.png)
* Object name filtering possible (*.jpg)
* S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer
* If two writes are made to a single **non-versioned** object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent
* If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you have to enable **versioning** on your bucket.

## üîåS3 - VPC Endpoints

A VPC endpoint is a **virtual** scalable networking component you create in a VPC and use as a private entry point to supported AWS services and third-party applications. Currently, two types of VPC endpoints can be used to connect to Amazon S3: ```Interface``` VPC endpoint and ```Gateway``` VPC endpoint. In both scenarios, the communications between the service consumer and the service provider never gets out of the AWS network.

Read more: [VPC Endpoints](/cheatsheets/aws/vpc/#vpc-endpoint)

* When you create a S3 ```VPC endpoint```, you can attach an endpoint ```Resource-Based``` policy to it that controls access to Amazon ```S3```.

* Here is a sample ```VPC``` endpoint policy to allow access to a specific ```S3``` bucket from within a ```VPC```:

  ```json
  {
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "Access-to-specific-bucket-only",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my_secure_bucket",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::my_secure_bucket/*"]
      }
    ]
  }	
  ```

  * While this is useful, as the number of buckets owned by the organization grows, it becomes difficult to keep track and manually specify newly created buckets in the Amazon ```S3``` VPC endpoint policy. For example, when a new S3 bucket is created in a particular account that the application running within a VPC needs access to, you have to **manually** edit the VPC endpoint policy to allow list the newly created ```S3``` bucket.

To make this simpler to manage, we look at Amazon S3 ```Access Points```.

## üõÇS3 ‚Äì Access Points

S3 ```Access Points``` are **unique** hostnames that you can create to enforce distinct permissions and network controls for any request made through the Access Point.

Some key features of S3 Access Points:

- Access Points contain a ```hostname```, an AWS ```ARN```, and an AWS IAM ```Resource-Based``` policy.
- Access Points by default have a specific setting to ```Block Public Access```.
- Access Points are **unique** to an ```Account``` and ```Region```.
- Access Points can have custom ```IAM``` permissions for a user or application.
- Access Points can have custom ```IAM``` permissions to specific objects in a bucket via a ```prefix``` to precisely control access.
- Access Points can be configured to accept requests only from a virtual private cloud (```VPC```) to restrict Amazon S3 data access to a private network.

- The following image shows one example of how you can use S3 Access Points to manage access to shared datasets on Amazon S3.

![S3-Access-Points](/images/uploads/aws-s3-vpc-access-points.png)

- The scenario involves securing an ```S3``` bucket to allow specific groups - Developers, Testers, and DevOps access to their designated ```prefixes``` while restricting everyone else. Furthermore, all access to the bucket must be funneled through a ```VPC Endpoint```, ensuring no direct public internet access is possible.

  - Developers need **read/write** access to the ```/develop``` prefix.
  - Testers need **read/write** access to the ```/test``` prefix.
  - DevOps needs **read/write** access to **both** the ```/develop``` and ```/test``` prefixes.

- All access to the ```S3``` bucket is restricted to a specific ```VPC```. This is achieved by creating a ```VPC Endpoint``` for ```S3``` and configuring the bucket policy to deny all requests not originating from that endpoint.
- A single S3 ```Access Point``` is used to manage all group permissions, simplifying policy management. 
- Here is the ```Resource-Based``` policy for the S3 ```Access Point```:

  ```json

      "Version": "2012-10-17",

#### S3 - Multi-Region Access Points

- Provide a ```global endpoint``` that span ```S3``` buckets in multiple AWS regions
- Dynamically route requests to the nearest ```S3``` bucket (lowest latency)
- Bi-directional ```S3``` bucket **replication** rules are created to keep data in sync across regions
- Failover Controls ‚Äì allows you to shift requests across S3 buckets in different AWS regions within minutes (**Active-Active** or **Active-Passive**)

![S3-Multi-Region-Access-Point](/images/uploads/aws-s3-multi-region-access-points.png)
## (Œª) S3 - Object Lambda

If you want to provide different customized views of ```S3``` objects (e.g., **redacted**, **filtered**, **enahanced**) to multiple applications, there are currently two options: 
- You either create, store, and maintain additional derivative copies of the data
- You build and manage infrastructure as a proxy layer in front of S3 (```APIGateWay``` + ```Lambda```) to intercept and process data as it is requested. 

Both options add complexity and costs.

- ```S3 Object Lambda``` solves this problem. It intercepts standard S3 ```GET``` requests and routes them through a ```Lambda``` function that transforms the object before returning it. The client still thinks it's calling ```S3```. 
- It works natively with S3 ```Access Points```, ```IAM``` policies, and bucket permissions.

![S3-Object-Lambda](/images/uploads/aws-s3-object-lambda.png)

There are many use cases that can be simplified by this approach, for example:

- Redacting **PII** for analytics or non-production environments.
- Converting across data formats, such as converting ```XML``` to ```JSON```.
- Augmenting data with information from other services or databases.
- Compressing or decompressing files as they are being downloaded.
- Resizing and watermarking images on the fly using caller-specific details, such as the user who requested the object.
- Implementing custom authorization rules to access data.

## üîêS3 - Object Lock

- S3 ```Object Lock``` enables **write-once-read-many** (```WORM```) protection for objects in Amazon S3. 
- It prevents deletion or modification for a specified retention period or indefinitely (via **legal hold**). 
- This is crucial for compliance use cases.
- Glacier ```Vault Lock``` applies a similar ```WORM``` model at the vault level in Amazon ```S3 Glacier```. 
- Once a Vault Lock policy is set and locked, it enforces compliance controls‚Äîsuch as denying deletion requests‚Äîacross all archives in the vault. 
- This is ideal for long-term archival with regulatory retention requirements.

## ‚ú®Best Practices

* **use random hash prefix for keys and ensure a random access pattern**, as S3 stores object lexicographically randomness helps distribute the contents across multiple partitions for better performance
* use parallel threads and **Multipart upload for faster writes**
* use parallel threads and **Range Header GET for faster reads**
* for list operations with large number of objects, its better to build a secondary index in DynamoDB
* use **Versioning to protect from unintended overwrites and deletions**, but this does not protect against bucket deletion
* use **VPC S3 Endpoints** with VPC to transfer data using Amazon internal network
