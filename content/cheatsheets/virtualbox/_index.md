### VirtualBox CheatSheet

VirtualBox is one the most popular Hypervisor platforms available in Windows for free. Similar ones are VMWare, Hyper-V, Docker and others.

In order to stick to the "Everything as Code (EaC) paradigm" I have been using VirtualBox since it's easy to get going. Putting together some cheatsheets for future reference for me and others.

Happy Virtualization guys :smile:
